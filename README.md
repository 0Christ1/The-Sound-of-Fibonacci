# The Sound of Fibonacci

1. I used cycling '74 Max 8 to perform the sound of Fibonacci sequence by the different key sounds of piano. 
2. You can see the screenshot on below to find the key sounds I used to represent integers from 1 to 9. (0 means pause).
3. If you want to try this on your own, feel free to download my file and the correct version of [Max 8](https://cycling74.com/downloads)

## little update
1. I add a delay object to stop the sound in 60 seconds for time sake.
